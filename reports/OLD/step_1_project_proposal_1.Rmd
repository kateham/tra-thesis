## Section

For my project, I would like to incorporate the work I am doing for my senior thesis
on housing in the Bay Area. I have obtained a dataset from CoreLogic using Stanford's
license, which contains property deed and tax data in California over the past
few years. 

For my project, I would like to describe and map trends in changes of ownership
in properties in a select number of cities (probably Redwood City, Alameda, Oakland,
and Mountain View). My project would map the total ownership changes over time,
and then, using address data, geocode the ownership changes to look at frequency
by neighborhood-level geography.
