## Scripts

I created a variety of new scripts to download and clean the both the
CoreLogic and ACS data and to turn them into sf objects as possible. The
scripts are as functions so that any city in the Bay Area should be able
to be filtered for, though I chose to start with Redwood City. (See
\~scripts/README.md for more info.)

# Preliminary EDA

city\_readwood.Rmd walks through process of calculating eligibility
