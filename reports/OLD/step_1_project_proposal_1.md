## Section

For my project, I would like to incorporate the work I am doing for my
senior thesis on housing in the Bay Area. I have obtained a dataset from
CoreLogic using Stanfordâ€™s license, which contains property deed and tax
data in California over the past few years.

For my project, I would like to describe and map trends in changes of
ownership in properties in a select number of cities (probably Redwood
City, Alameda, Oakland, and Mountain View). My project would map the
total ownership changes over time, and then, using address data, geocode
the ownership changes to look at frequency by neighborhood-level
geography.
