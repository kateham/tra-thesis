## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
test <- read_csv("C:/Users/katea/OneDrive - Leland Stanford Junior University/SENIOR THESIS/Data Analysis/Alameda - Eviction and TRA Data/baserent_type_r.csv")
```
```{r}
test_tidy <-
  test %>% 
  pivot_longer(-`Row Labels`, names_to = "unit_type", values_to = "evictions")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
test_tidy <-
  test_tidy %>% 
  mutate(baserent = fct_relevel(`Row Labels`, "$400 - $599", "$600 - $799", "$800 - $999"))

test_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(baserent, evictions)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = unit_type, color = unit_type), size = 1, se = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = "$3400 - $3599", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(aes("$3400 - $3599", 22, label = "Median Rent"), color = "grey50") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "purple", "orange", "blue", "black")) +
  labs(
    x = "Base Rent",
    y = "Eviction Notices",
    color = "Select Unit Types",
    title = "No-Fault Evictions by Base Rent in Alameda city (2016 - 2019)",
    caption = "Source: Alameda PRR; Zillow Rent Index"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
