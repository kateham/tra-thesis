## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
RESIDENTIAL <- c(0:199)

TEST <- cl_santaclara %>% 
  filter(land_use %in% RESIDENTIAL, situs_city == "MOUNTAIN VIEW")

TEST %>% 
  select(situs_house_number, situs_street_name, year_built) %>% 
  filter(situs_street_name == "SAN LUIS", situs_house_number %in% c(2025))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
